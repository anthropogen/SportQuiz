    - name: Tennis
      rules: 'Tennis is a racket sport played between two players (singles) or two
        teams of two players each (doubles). The objective is to score points by
        hitting the ball in such a way that the opponent cannot return it correctly.
        Here are the basic rules:


        1. Court: Tennis is played on a rectangular
        court with a net stretched across the middle. The court is divided into two
        halves by the net.


        2. Scoring: Points are scored as follows: -
        Love (0 points) - 15 points - 30 points - 40 points - Game (winning four
        points)


        3. Serving: The match begins with a serve, where one player
        throws the ball into the air and hits it over the net into the opponent''s
        service box. The server gets two chances (first and second serves) to get
        the ball into the service box.


        4. Rally: After the serve, players
        hit the ball back and forth over the net until one player fails to return
        the ball within the court boundaries or commits a fault.


        5. Faults:
        Faults include not getting the serve into the correct service box, hitting
        the net with the serve, or hitting the ball out of bounds during a rally.


        6.
        Scoring System: Games are won by winning at least four points and at least
        two points more than the opponent. Matches are won by winning a specified
        number of sets (usually best of three sets for women and best of five sets
        for men in major tournaments).


        7. Tiebreak: If a set is tied at
        six games each, a tiebreak game is played to determine the winner of the
        set. The first player/team to reach at least seven points with a margin of
        two points wins the tiebreak.


        8. Doubles: In doubles matches, teams
        of two players each play against each other. Players take turns serving and
        receiving within their team.


        9. Grand Slam Tournaments: Tennis
        is played in major tournaments known as Grand Slam events, including the
        Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and US Open. These tournaments have
        specific rules and regulations.


        10. Code of Conduct: Players must
        adhere to a code of conduct, which includes rules on sportsmanship, behavior,
        and attire.


        These rules govern the sport of tennis, which combines
        skill, strategy, and athleticism.'

    - name: Rugby
      rules: 'Rugby is a team sport played between two teams of fifteen players each.
        The objective is to score points by carrying, passing, kicking, or grounding
        the ball in the opponent''s in-goal area (try zone). Here are the basic rules:


        1.
        Field: The game is played on a rectangular field called a pitch, with goal
        posts at each end. The field is divided into zones such as the 22-meter line,
        halfway line, and try line.


        2. Players: Each team has fifteen players
        divided into forwards and backs. Forwards typically play a more physical
        role, while backs focus on speed and handling.


        3. Scoring: Points
        are scored in several ways:  - Try: 5 points for grounding the ball in the
        opponent''s in-goal area. - Conversion: 2 additional points by kicking the
        ball through the goal posts after a try. - Penalty Kick: 3 points by kicking
        the ball through the goal posts after a penalty infringement by the opposing
        team. - Drop Goal: 3 points by kicking the ball through the goal posts during
        open play.


        4. Passing: Players can pass the ball backward to teammates.
        The ball can be kicked forward or carried forward, but not passed forward.


        5.
        Tackling: Players can be tackled by the opposing team to stop their progress.
        Tackles must be made below the shoulders and without dangerous or illegal
        contact.


        6. Rucks and Mauls: When a player is tackled and brought
        to the ground, a ruck forms over the ball. Players from both teams compete
        for possession. A maul occurs when players from both teams bind together
        around a ball carrier who is on their feet.


        7. Scrums: Scrums are
        used to restart play after certain rule infringements or when the ball goes
        out of bounds. Players bind together and push against the opposing team to
        contest possession of the ball.


        8. Lineouts: Lineouts occur when
        the ball goes out of bounds. Players from both teams line up and lift teammates
        to contest possession of the thrown-in ball.


        9. Fouls and Penalties:
        Penalties are awarded for rule infringements such as high tackles, offsides,
        or dangerous play. Penalties may result in free kicks, penalty kicks, or
        yellow/red cards.


        10. Game Duration: A standard rugby match consists
        of two halves of 40 minutes each, with a halftime break. Additional time
        may be played for stoppages.


        Rugby is played in various formats
        including rugby union, rugby league, and sevens, each with variations in

    - name: Basketball
      rules: 'Basketball is a team sport played between two teams of five players
        each. The objective is to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent''s
        hoop. Here are the basic rules:


        1. Court: The game is played on
        a rectangular court with a hoop (basket) at each end. The court is divided
        into two halves by a midcourt line.


        2. Players: Each team has five
        players on the court at a time. Players are categorized into positions such
        as guards, forwards, and centers.


        3. Scoring: Points are scored
        by shooting the ball through the opponent''s hoop. A field goal inside the
        three-point line counts as two points, while a shot beyond the three-point
        line counts as three points. Free throws, awarded for certain fouls, count
        as one point each.


        4. Dribbling: Players move the ball by bouncing
        it on the floor, known as dribbling. They must continue to dribble while
        moving, except when shooting, passing, or stopping.


        5. Passing:
        Players can pass the ball to teammates using their hands. Passing allows
        teams to move the ball quickly and create scoring opportunities.


        6.
        Fouls: Fouls are called for illegal physical contact such as pushing, holding,
        or blocking. Players committing fouls may receive personal fouls, team fouls,
        or technical fouls, depending on the severity of the offense.


        7.
        Violations: Violations include traveling (moving without dribbling the ball),
        double dribbling (dribbling with both hands simultaneously or stopping and
        starting again), and goaltending (interfering with the ball as it descends
        towards the hoop).


        8. Game Duration: A standard basketball game
        consists of four quarters, each lasting 10 or 12 minutes depending on the
        level of play (professional, college, or youth).


        9. Overtime: If
        the score is tied at the end of regulation time, overtime periods may be
        played to determine the winner.


        10. Competitions: Basketball is
        played in various competitions, including leagues (NBA, EuroLeague), international
        tournaments (FIBA World Cup, Olympics), and college basketball (NCAA).

    - name: Cricket
      rules: 'Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players
        each on a field. The game is divided into innings, with each team taking
        turns to bat and field. Here are the basic rules:


        1. Objective:
        The batting team aims to score runs by hitting the ball and running between
        two sets of wooden stumps (wickets) at either end of the pitch. The fielding
        team tries to dismiss the batsmen and restrict the scoring.


        2.
        Pitch: The pitch is a rectangular area with a length of 22 yards (20.12 meters)
        and a width of 10 feet (3.05 meters), with a wicket at each end.


        3.
        Innings: Each team gets one innings to bat. An innings is complete when ten
        of the eleven batsmen are out (dismissed), or a set number of overs (a set
        of six consecutive balls bowled by a bowler) are bowled.


        4. Batting:
        Batsmen score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. They
        can also score runs by hitting boundaries (four runs if the ball reaches
        the boundary rope, six runs if it clears the boundary on the full). Batsmen
        can be dismissed in various ways, such as being bowled (the ball hits the
        stumps and dislodges the bails), caught (a fielder catches the ball hit by
        the batsman before it touches the ground), run out (fielders hit the wicket
        with the ball while the batsman is running between the wickets), etc.


        5.
        Bowling: The bowling team (fielding team) consists of bowlers who bowl the
        ball towards the batsmen. Bowlers aim to dismiss batsmen and restrict their
        scoring by bowling accurately and tactically.


        6. Fielding: Fielders
        try to stop the ball and dismiss batsmen. They are strategically placed around
        the field to catch the ball, stop it from reaching the boundary, and return
        it to the wicket-keeper or bowler.


        7. Scoring: The batting team''s
        score is represented by the number of runs scored by the batsmen. The fielding
        team''s objective is to limit the batting team''s score and dismiss all batsmen
        as quickly and efficiently as possible.


        8. Extras: Runs awarded
        to the batting team without the batsmen hitting the ball, such as wides (balls
        bowled outside the batsman''s reach), no-balls (illegal deliveries), byes
        (runs scored when the ball passes the batsman and the wicket-keeper without
        being hit), and leg-byes (runs scored after the ball touches the batsman''s
        body).


        9. Result: The team with the highest score at the end of
        their innings wins the match. If both teams score the same number of runs,
        the match is a tie or a draw, depending on the format of the game.


        10.
        Formats: Cricket is played in different formats, including Test cricket (played
        over five days), One Day Internationals (ODIs, limited to 50 overs per innings),
        and Twenty20 (T20, limited to 20 overs per innings), each with variations
        in rules and strategies.


        These are the basic rules of cricket,
        which combine elements of strategy, skill, and teamwork, making it a widely
        followed and beloved sport globally.'
